# TODO List for CFD Study

## 📚 Documentation
- [ ] Update README with case details
- [ ] Add references and validation sources
- [ ] Prepare final report (PDF or presentation)

## 🛠 Setup
- [ ] Define geometry and collect CAD or STL files
- [ ] Generate mesh (structured/unstructured/hybrid)
- [ ] Document mesh statistics (cell count, refinement, quality)
- [ ] Setup boundary and initial conditions

## ⚙️ Simulation
- [ ] Select solver (e.g., simpleFoam, pimpleFoam, Fluent)
- [ ] Configure turbulence/physics models
- [ ] Run initial test case for stability
- [ ] Perform full simulation
- [ ] Check convergence (residuals, forces, balances)

## 📊 Post-Processing
- [ ] Extract key values (lift, drag, pressure drop, heat transfer)
- [ ] Generate plots (residuals, coefficients, profiles)
- [ ] Create visualizations (contours, streamlines, animations)
- [ ] Compare results with experimental/literature data

## Perform sensitivity analysis
- [ ] Iterative convergence
- [ ] Grid convergence
- [ ] Temporal convergence
- [ ] Effect of physical modelling

## ✅ Final Checks
- [ ] Verify reproducibility (clean run from scratch)
- [ ] Organize repository structure
- [ ] Ensure all results are backed up
